# Poliswag

Poliswag is a Python Discord Bot that integrates a [Pokémon Scanner](https://pogoleiria.pt) made available by [PoGoLeiria](https://discord.gg/pASCYbp).

This bot integrates with those services and manages them, it also prepares data for the [PoGoLeiria](https://github.com/rubendgpedrosa/PoGoLeiria) React Native Mobile App.

Some of the main features include:
> 1. Fail safes in order to maintain the [Pokémon Scanner](https://pogoleiria.pt) working.
> 2. Remote control through [Discord](https://discord.gg/pASCYbp) text channels, allowing the management of the notifications sent by the [Pokémon Scanner](https://pogoleiria.pt).
